# tea-time
- inspired by @nashallery's "Coding my first app from scratch (aesthetic & cozy raw html css :3)" where they make an egg cooking timer for their crush.

- this is something that will be a timer for the amount of time someone steeps their tea that has cute illustrations. (there will be options for 5 different minute options: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 minutes)
- this is just a rough draft, have no idea if this will be completed.
- this is my first project of this kind.
